1. Expand and simplify (4 points)

\[
4x(3x^2 + 5x^8) - 2x^3(1 - 5x^6)
\]

2. Find the greatest common factor (GCF) and factor it out (4 points)

\[
9x^2y^5 - 3x^3y^2
\]

3. Test your answer to question 1 by ``plugging in'' a  value for $x$;
ensure that you get the same result
when $x$ is plugged into the original equation
and when $x$ is plugged into the final, expanded and simplified equation
(2 points)
